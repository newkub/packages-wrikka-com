# Design Principles

This document outlines the core design principles behind the Wrikka AI SDK.

## 1. Developer Experience First

- **Intuitive API**: Clean, consistent, and predictable interfaces
- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript for better development experience
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear examples and guides for all features

## 2. Performance

- **Efficient**: Optimized for speed and low latency
- **Modular**: Import only what you need
- **Tree-shakeable**: Keep your bundle size minimal

## 3. Extensibility

- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality with custom plugins
- **Hooks**: Tap into the SDK's lifecycle events
- **Adapters**: Support for various AI providers and services

## 4. Security

- **Secure by Default**: Best practices implemented out of the box
- **Token Management**: Safe handling of API keys and credentials
- **Data Privacy**: Your data stays yours

## 5. Cross-Platform

- **Universal**: Works in browser, Node.js, and edge runtimes
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use with any JavaScript framework or vanilla JS
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different environments and constraints

## 6. Community Driven

- **Open Source**: Transparent development process
- **RFC Process**: Major changes go through community review
- **Accessible**: Built with accessibility in mind
